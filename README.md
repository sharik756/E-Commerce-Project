## Project Insights

The E-commerce Analysis project utilizes Python along with popular data science libraries, including Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on order transactions from an e-commerce platform.

### Key Outputs

1. **Total Orders Correctly Charged**: The analysis reveals that there were 18 orders where customers were correctly charged, resulting in a total revenue of Rs. 790.5.

2. **Total Orders Overcharged**: The investigation uncovers 38 orders where customers were overcharged, amounting to a total revenue of Rs. 1791.4.

3. **Total Orders Undercharged**: One of the key focuses of the analysis is to identify orders that were undercharged. The analysis identifies and records these specific orders, which require further attention for revenue optimization.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: The data for this project was obtained from the e-commerce platform's database, which contains detailed information about order transactions.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: The data was carefully preprocessed using Pandas to handle missing values, correct data types, and eliminate duplicate entries.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Using Python's visualization libraries, we created insightful visualizations such as bar plots, pie charts, and histograms to gain a deeper understanding of the transaction data.

4. **Identifying Undercharged Orders**: Through data filtering and analysis, we successfully identified and categorized the undercharged orders, aiding the company in rectifying the billing issues.

5. **Enhancing Customer Experience**: By understanding the correct and incorrect billing trends, we aim to enhance the overall customer experience and satisfaction.

## Next Steps

The E-commerce Analysis project serves as a foundation for further research and optimization of the e-commerce platform. The insights gained from this analysis can be utilized to implement improved billing processes and detect potential revenue leaks.

If you are interested in the details of this analysis, you can find the Jupyter Notebook containing the complete code and findings in the [E-commerce Analysis Notebook](./notebooks/e-commerce-analysis.ipynb).

Let's continue exploring the world of data together and make informed decisions for a better e-commerce experience!
